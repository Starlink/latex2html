Overview

The translator: 

 o breaks up a document into one or more components as specified by
   the user, 
 o provides optional iconic navigation panels on every page which
   contain links to other parts of the document,  
 o handles inlined equations, right-justified
   numbered equations, tables, or figures and any arbitrary environment, 
 o can produce output suitable for browsers that support inlined images
   or character based browsers (as specified by the user), 
 o handles definitions of new commands, environments, and theorems
   even when these are defined in external style files, 
 o handles footnotes, tables of contents, lists of figures and tables,
   bibliographies, and can generate an  index, 
 o translates cross-references into hyperlinks and extends the
   LaTeX cross-referencing mechanism to work not just
   within a document but between documents which may reside in
   remote locations, 
 o translates accent and special character
   commands to the equivalent ISO-LATIN-1
   character set where possible, 
 o recognizes hypertext links (to multimedia resources or arbitrary
   internet services such as sound/video/ftp/http/news) and links which
   invoke arbitrary program scripts, all expressed as
   LaTeX commands, 
 o recognizes conditional text which is intended only for the hypertext
   version, or only for the paper (DVI) version, 
 o can include raw HTML in a LaTeX document (e.g. in order to specify
   interactive forms), 
 o can deal sensibly at least with the Common LaTeX
   commands summarized at the back of the LaTeX blue
   book [1], 
 o will try and translate any document with embedded
   LaTeX commands irrespective of whether it is
   complete or syntactically legal. 

Pointers to the User Manual
***************************

The latex2html program includes its own manual page. 
The manual page can be viewed by saying %nroff -man latex2html.  

See the online documentation at 
http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/nikos/tex2html/doc/latex2html/latex2html.html
or the <latex2htmldir>/doc/latex2html.tex 
file for more information and examples.

See below on how to make your own local copy of the manual in HTML.

Requirements
************

  Please consult the section "Requirements" of the online manual at
http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/nikos/tex2html/doc/manual/manual.html
for more information as well as *active* links to any utilities
that you may require. You may use Archie to find the source code 
of any utilities you might need. Archie is at 
http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi-bin/archie.html

The requirements for using LaTeX2HTML
depend on the kind of translation it is asked to perform as follows: 

 1. LaTeX commands but without equations, figures, tables, etc. 
    o Perl (version 4.0 - RCSfile: perl.c,v - Revision: 4.0.1.8 -
      Date: 1993/02/05 19:39:30 - Patch level: 36) 

      Warning: You really DO need Perl at patch level 36 or later
      Versions of LaTeX2HTML earlier than 0.7a4 work *only* with 
      Perl 4 at patch level 36. Later versions of  LaTeX2HTML work 
      both with Perl 4 at patch level 36 and Perl 5. *No* version 
      of LaTeX2HTML will work with Perl 4 at earlier patch levels.

    o DBM or NDBM, the Unix DataBase Management system.

 2. LaTeX commands with equations, figures, tables, etc. 
   As above plus 
    o latex, 
    o dvips (version 5.516 or later) or dvipsk. 
    o gs (Ghostscript version 2.6.1 or later). 
    o The pbmplus OR netpbm library. Some of the filters in
      those libraries are used during the postscript to GIF conversion.

 3. Transparent inlined images
   If you dislike the ugly white background color of the generated inlined
   images then you should get either get the netpbm library (instead of
   the older pbmplus) OR install the giftrans filter by Andreas Ley
   <ley@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>. Version 1.10.2 is known to work without
   problems but later versions should also be OK. 

Because by default the translator makes use of inlined images in the final
HTML output, it would be better to have a viewer which supports the <IMG>
tag, such as NCSA Mosaic. If only a character based browser is available or
if you want the generated documents to be more portable then the translator
can be used with the -ascii_mode option. 

If ghostscript or the pbmplus (or netpbm) library are not available
it is still possible to use the translator with the -no_images option. 

If you intend to use any of the special features of the translator 
then you have to include the html.sty file in any LaTeX documents that
use them. 

Installation
************

Please consult the section "Installing LaTeX2HTML" of the online manual at
http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/nikos/tex2html/doc/manual/manual.html
for more information.

To install LaTeX2HTML you MUST do the following: 

 1. Specify where Perl is on your system. 
   In each of the files latex2html, texexpand, pstogif and 
   install-test, modify the first line saying where Perl is on your
   system. 

   Some system administrators do not allow Perl programs to run as shell
   scripts. This means that you may not be able to run any of the above
   programs. In this case change the first line in each of these programs
   from 

   #!/usr/local/bin/perl

   to 

   : # *-*-perl-*-*
       eval 'exec perl -S  $0 "$@"'
       if $running_under_some_shell;

 2. Specify where the external utilities are on your system. 
   In the file latex2html.config give the correct pathnames for
   some directories (the latex2html directory and the pbmplus or 
   netpbm library) and some executables (latex, dvips, gs).
   Note that it is possible to use LaTeX2HTML even if you don't have
   some of the external programs. While you're at it you may want to
   change some of the default options in the same file. 

 3. Run install-test. 
   This Perl script will make some changes in the latex2html file and
   then check whether the pathnames to any external utilities
   (specified during the previous step) are correct. It will not actually
   install the external utilities. 

   Don't forget to make install-test executable (using the 
   chmod command) before using it if necessary. You may also need to
   make the files pstogif, texexpand and latex2html
   executable if install-test fails to do it for you. 

   If for any reason you have trouble running install-test do not
   despair. Most of what it does is to do with checking your installation
   rather than actually installing anything. To do a manual installation just
   change the variable LATEX2HTMLDIR in the beginning of the file 
   latex2html to point to the directory where the LaTeX2HTML files
   can be found. 

This is enough for the main installation but you may also want to do some of
the following: 

 o To use the new LaTeX commands which are defined in 
   html.sty: 
   Make sure that LaTeX knows where the html.sty file is, either by
   putting it in the same place as the other style files on your system, or
   by changing your TEXINPUTS shell environment variable, or by
   copying html.sty in the same directory as as your LaTeX source file. 

 o To set up different initialisation files: 
   For a ``per user'' initialisation file, copy the file 
   dot.latex2html-init in the home directory of any user that
   wants it, modify it according to her preferences and rename it as 
   .latex2html-init. At runtime, both the 
   latex2html.config file and $HOME/.latex2html-init
   file will be loaded, but the latter will take precedence. 

   You can also set up a ``per directory'' initialisation file by copying a
   version of .latex2html-init in each directory you would like it
   to be effective. An initialisation file 
   /X/Y/Z/.latex2html-init will take precedence over all
   other initialisation files if /X/Y/Z is the ``current directory'' when 
   LaTeX2HTML is invoked. 

 o To make your own local copies of the LaTeX2HTML icons: 
   Please copy the icons subdirectory to a place under your WWW
   tree where they can be served by your server. Then modify the value
   of the $ICONSERVER variable in latex2html.config
   accordingly. 

   Warning: If you cannot do that bear in mind that these icons will have
   to travel from Leeds!!! Also, your documents will depend on our
   server being operational in the first place. 

 o To make your own local copy of the LaTeX2HTML documentation: 
   This will also be a good test of your installation. To do it run LaTeX2
   HTML on the file doc/manual.tex. You will get better results if
   you run LaTeX first on the same file in order to create some auxiliary
   files.
